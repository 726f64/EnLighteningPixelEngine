Now a generic WS2812 Pixel Program

Made repo

09.11.2017  Byte order is Red, Green, Blue
            Needed ASM to output bytes quick enough to work.
            RAM is at 0x00A0
            Need test out numbers that work - 20 pixels OK red/blue

            Try out some effects using a single string
            Later this will be arms of the finished star effect.

11.11.2017  Copied Radial Catherine Wheel to get a version that grabs
            data from the UART output of a Raspberry Pi eg 150x bytes=50 pixels.
            There is a start of frame that can cause an interrupt.

            Currently issues that TMR1 when enabled for the '1ms ticks' causes lock up

13.11.2017  Lots of issues getting UART to work + realise that it will be too slow/unreliable.
            Pulled udp Pi code from DMX512 project - working OK
            Chosen to port to a PIC16F18857 which has 4x CLC plus 2x SPI (one for WS2812 timing and one for control from RPi)

10.11.2017  I broke the Pi Zero W yesterday and wanted to still get the lights working in the trees so 
            modified the code again hoping to just alternate Magenta/Cyan/Yellow etc. Must be a lead issue
            as the board appeared t work but the lights did not.
            Started to go off Vixen3 again due to the issues with setting up PiZ/WiFi/Signal strengths and 
            needing the PC running. Thinking self contained is good !

            But  do like the effects so perhaps now I have the WS2812 driver as a module I can be more creative
            with my C code to do those effects? Code now is to have a separate EffectsFSR. Also add in a 25ms timer
            that will update the LEDs (if not in middle of recalulating the string). Or use a separate buffer ?

29.5.2018   Tried to take a more generic approach. Added Firefly mode. Added to Github for version control.

03.06.2018  Add switch to step through, ignoring the duration values via a global flag?
